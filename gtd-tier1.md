# GTD Tier 1



- The simplest system



- Items are important/urgent.
- Train your brain on triage to pick the most important and store the rest away for fighting later
- Get multiple work surfaces.  Mainblocks, weekend, burndown, phone calls etc.
- Focus on main blocks.
- When you have small chunks of time, burndown things.
- 



## Basic Requirements

- Have a system where you can save thoughts to at any time (OF w/ siri on computer, watch, phone, share to OF from browser, or email)
- You need to inventory thoughts
- Triage thoughts into actions
- Group actions into projects
- Prioritize projects according to goals
- Execute on projects according to importance and urgency

- Setting a due date which pops up when its coming due
- Setting a start date (which hides things until they are startable/should be started)



## GTD Goals

Make sure to define these:

1. Vision
2. Mission
3. Outcomes
4. Projects

This is not a todo system.  You don't want to check it off and see it go away.

Goals last over larg arcs of time.  And you need to be able to reflect on that progress.

## Weekly GTD

On a weekly basis, these are the main steps to bucket your actions under

1. Retro (look back on week, review, what improvements)
2. Find priorities (anything new, upcoming)
3. Find Open slots for next week
4. Schedule priorities into open slots (not everything will fit)
5. Sharpen Saw



## Main Buckets

- Today: if it has a due date, I am confident it'll come here and get done.
- Todo: if it is important, I know it'll go on this list and get prioritized in open blocks
- Waiting: I know I'll review this weekly, a safe place to kick things back
- Burndown: currently not trustworthy, things that go here don't seem to get reviewed as often as I like
- Inbox: where new things come in; a good place to see new projects or patterns emerge.

Other work surface areas that you have to work to make reliable: call, weekend, CPA, etc.

## Symptoms

### Feeling Overwhelmed

focus on doing less.  Have a list of all the things in your mind, and kick things out that aren't priorities.

1. Not going to do
2. Defer (doing this week? No -> defer.  If it doesn't have a due date, put it in a place where you know you'll come back to it (waiting list, backlog, inbox, etc))
3. Delegate
4. Prioritize

(see 4 quadrant chart)

This is a muscle that needs to be built.  It'll get easier the more you do it.

### Todo List is too big

- You are trying to do too much.  You need to make prioritize compete and say no to more, or defer more.  Deferring is easy and just adds up.  If you can't tie your projects to your Vision/Mission/Outcomes, it is likely something you should kill.



### Too much context switching

Try to define one *primary* priority each week.  This will lead to killing down the big things and doing the minimum to keep the rest afloat.  After time, you'll have killed all the main priorities faster than slowly killing 5 big priorities at once.



### Foundation vs Priorities

Foundation items are things like sleep, nutrition, meditation and exercise.  They are table stakes - not goals or priorities.  If they are at risk, you have to fix these first for long-term success (short term sometimes they must be sacrificed).



### Harmony vs Balance

This is the idea that you don't need to balance your time evenly.  You need to put your time where the fires are.  If certain goals are on track, but one is behind, it is okay to allocate a disproportiate amount of itme to it.



### FAQ

- How do I know if I'm working on the right things?
  - The retro process should be prompting you to check progress towards yearly goals.  If after too many retros, you see you aren't making progress, then you have to ask if you have missing priorities that should be there or if you are just spending your time on the wrong things.  This usually happens because you are in a reactionary mindset.
