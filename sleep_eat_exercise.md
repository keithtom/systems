## 1. Sleep Eat Exercise (Meditate)

Start with a strong foundation.  If you are in a funk, ask:

1. Are you sleeping well?
2. Are you eating well?
3. Are you exercising?
4. Do you need to meditate?  (Probably yes)



For sleep, you should make sure to get aroud 8 hours uninterrupted.  Lately I have not.

For eating, you can look at your macros and see how many calories you should intake.  For most of my life, I've been accustomed to eating double what I need.

For exercising, having cardio and weightlifting are pretty good for me.  Generally aim for 2-3 workouts a week + 1/2 cardio exercises.  Make sure to stretch.

For meditating, I generally forget what it feels like to be present until I get into regular meditation again.  I just remember life feeling more crystal clear, and my mind is just present again, not running around to the future and back.  It is hard to know if you need this unless you've recently been present again.
