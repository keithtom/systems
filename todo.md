# Todo System



- Outline how my GTD system works.  Why have I made the systems I have made.







How'd I get here?



- Problem: I have too many things coming into me at once (LH VP Eng, general family life, so many work contexts and projects).

  - Context: this all started because my "this week" view became clogged up with more than a week worth of work.
  - my GTD item: 'Work on “Next” perspective so I can keep “This week” clean; document the purpose of each view.'
  - I basically wanted a place to kick the can down the road for at least a week so i dont' have to keep revisiting the universe and getting overwhelmed.
    - which has proven to work.  just focusing on my baseline this week was great.  although i have no tangible progress either.
  - makes me go back to the purpose of all of this.
    - i want to know im working on important stuff, not reacting to urgent (This is prob habbit).  and htat it builds to something (this is prob planning at a higher level w/ goal setting).
    - and i dont want to have to think about it once i get into my todo mode.

- Solution: Easily log items into omnifocus, then triaged

  - 1) don't do them, not important
  - 2) do them and soon
  - 3) do them but later

- Actual Implementation

  - **Today List**: I have a today list of things i must do today.  It must be reduced to 0 every day by completion or deferal.
  - **Todo List:**
    - I have a list of things that should be worked on next when my today is empty.  They are generally important but not urgent, so I should be working on them, but if I don't finish, it is okay.
    - It should roughly correspond to 1 week of work so I can focus and plan that far ahead.
    - This should have next steps broken down into simple actions that can be worked on immediately
    - Side note: this avoids the pattern kicking items due date repeatedly down the road
  - **Next List:**
    - **WIP.**  Next list should be next most important and correspond to a month or quarter worth of work (this creates the need for a 2020 list which sucks).
    - first pass groups thigns into quarters bc that's kind easier.
      - but everything is fuzzy at this level.  looking at projects seems easier
        - but sometimes I kinda just care about 1 item in a project? or the project itself?  maybe 1 item should be a project?
      - how do i determine which projects go in and out of 2020 list?
        - isn't this what omnifocus review is suppose to do?  right now it is too tedious to review all my projects.  maybe that's because i have fake projects?  cleaning out projects will help this.
    - also what about continuous ongoing projects like Our Marriage vs SBI which has a end point.
      - its rough going from next which is project based down to this week which is action based.
      - i will eventually be going through and tagging an item for "this week" out of all of them...
  - **Minor Work contexts**
    - These create new surfaces to do work on to get improved efficiency for little tasks
      - burndown
      - calls
      - outside
      - home

  

- anti patterns

  - leaving an email lying in your inbox so you can remember to do it later







# Todo Systems



- the today list.  things either have a due date or not.
  - a common mistake is that most things don't really have a due date.  you need to get into the habit of asking, "what happens if I don't do this?  fight your first reaction, and ask yourself, 'no, really, what is the worst thing that actually happens?'".  it often isn't as bad as you think.
  - few things truly have a due date.  only put things that truly need to get done to today in a special list called "Today List"
  - you must build a muscle memory of *always* finishing your today list.  you can complete or punt the tasks, but at the end of the day, it must be 0.  this will build trust and confidence in the today list.  and when you punt, you'll realize, this wasn't really due today.
  - ideally since your today list is small, you will burn it down first.
  - some examples of include:
    - work out today (i genuinely need to get this done today, although i sometimes punt)
    - routine items like brushing teeth
    - closing my work day (i try to write mini conclusions so i can pickup my work again faster next time, especially for deeply focussed tasks like developing software - i need to write down all my context to pick it up next time)
- the todo list.  things that don't have a due date:
  - once you've finished all the things that have to get done this moment, you are now free to work on what's important.
  - the most naive strategy is to just work on the important & urgent things first, then the important & non-urgent things next.  most people make a mistake of working on the urgent & unimportant things next - which is by definition a mistake.
  - examples
    - something that's important & urgent might be taxes.  it definitely important and urgent because it has a due date, and you don't want to wait until the last day to work on them.  
    - something that's important but not-urgent might be improving your todo system.  if you can improve your productivity by 10% for the rest of your life with good habits, that's fairly important.  but it isn't urgent.  waiting till tomorrow isn't a big deal.  and that's why these tasks get overlooked.
    - some examples of unimportant & urgent might be like getting notifications on social media.  there's a lot of things designed to grab our attention because it makes advertising dollars.  a harder example is a ringing phone, which is very urgent, but it isn't clear if it is important or not.  email and text messages are similar.
  - if you have a list of the most important items, sorted in order of urgency, then that's a good next step.  it might feel like you've just re-created the todo list (which is still an amazing invention considering its simplicity), but the real trick here is how diligent you are in grooming your lists to kill the unimportant stuff (just deciding to say 'not doing that'), and to really assessing what is important and how important.  how important means knowing your priorities.
- what are my priorities **WIP**
  - now  you should have a (short) today list and a (long) todo list
  -  the todo list is likely overwhelming.  it needs to be broken down.
    - is this actionable?  break it down.  what needs to get done first?  am i waiting to start?
- priorities **WIP**
  - in general, priorities should be set with a larger timeline in mind.  if you take a step back, and try to imagine what you want to get done this year, and write that list down, you'll see a list of your top priorities.  its okay if it isn't exhaustive.
  - the longer horizton the better, if you can come up with some life goals you want to live by, that's ideal.  then when you have a project, you should be able to tie it to some life goals.
- what are my contexts
  - one of the main weapons in breaking down my todo list is the use of special contexts.  a context is just a good way of organizing certain tasks into 'time slots'
  - "Primary": the main project that i'm working on.  
  - "Burndown": basically 
- triaging: plans always change
  - triaging is the act of sorting incoming new tasks into your various lists - does it have a due date? is it important? is it urgent?  what context will i work on it?

- what else?
  - todo list management is about capturing, triaging, and grouping into work contexts
  - calendar management
    - understanding open slots, big vs small
    - Scheduling items to be done making use of optimal work surfaces (when actually is burndown)





What are the steps to processing my overwhelming large priorities where im not sure if im forgetting thigns and i have a giant list that hurts to read through.

	- i need a way i can trust
	- that let's me focus on a small part of each list with confidence
 - when the list gets big, i need an easy way to trim down by various strategies, but dont worry about 'losing somethign'
   	- if i know i can punt to later, meaning i know its not now, then next list
      	- but then next list gets too big, and things get lost in a sea of things
	- i know somethign legitimately isn't important, i have no where to put it
	- it feels liek i should have differnet tags on top of todolist
	- its all in the list, but im adding work surfaces so i can ignore things that are specific to weekend, or session 3, or main work pieces
	- i often get overwhelmed.  when i focus, im okay.  but monthly planning made me re-open everything, cmbined w/ wanting to clean out my todo system.  i'm particularly low on energy, either from lack of sleep or emotionally exhausted from george floyd.  '
	- what is important? find priorities
	- make the fight each other.  prioritiation
	- cut them up into segments of time.  chunking.
- basically find ways to cut hte list up but have confidence i'm never removing anything from the list.
