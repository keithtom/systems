# Core System Concepts

- Projects are not goals
- Have 5-7 active goals
  - can have many projects
  - goals are the why
  - projects are the how
  - you can achieve 1 why in many ways (hows)
- goals , projects, tasks, resources
  - came from para method

### How to figure out what to work on

- daily planning is today list
  - things i have to get done today (e.g. due today)
  - shoudl be small.  but if you are in a reactionary mode, it is likely big.
  - Some days I literally have this list empty which is a good sign
- todo list
  - Once my today list is empty, I can work on my todo list
  - these can be import and non-urgent projects, or have an upcoming due date.  But this list should generally be the important stuff to work on next, and in a “proactive” manner.  When I do this well, I am almost exclusively working from the todo list
  - The todo list is also project level, not task level (today list is task level)
  - so I can decide to work on X project, bc there is nothing urgent (I finished my today list), and I know this is an important project (because I prioritized it in a separate weekly process), so I can just dig into the project and see all the tasks and start working on it

- system maintenance
  - I have specific processes for scheduling and prioritization (which are actually recurring weekly projects).  That helps keep the system self-maintainingsome ppl might find that unappealing but the way I think of it is, you spend 10% of your time to make sure the other 90% is the right stuff.
  - there should also be a retro process where you review your week, look for feedback and potential improvements.
  - and a process for triage of inbox and new projects.
- Capture & triage
  - inbox via voice
  - inbox w/ global shortcut.

- scheduling
  - layers on texture like when burndown
  - layers on time to the todo list so i can spread things over time; so i'm not just looking at important things all the time.
  - weekly planning
    - When your weekly planning feels too stressful because you can’t fit everything in, then I’d start doing quarterly planning
    - get texture of the week; e.g. when are there long uninterrupted blocks of time that's good for some projects, vs small chunks of time for small quick tasks.
    - this helps optimize how you spend your time.  you know when to work on X project/tasks because it fits into your week.
    - an example would be, schedule your calls while you are in the car; you know you'll be going to do outside errands on thursday, group in X days.
    - try to also have meeting grouped into 1-2 days so you aren't spread out and context switching a lot.

- Prioritization
  - start with life goals.  imagine you are at the end of your life.  imagine anything is possible, how would you have wanted to live your life?
  - these are life goals.  try to start with no more than 5-7 life goals.
  - goals and projects should align to life goals and that should help you prioritize easier.
  - 
  - My Prioritization tips are basically: start with life goals.  e.g. imagine you are at the end of your life, anything is possible, how would you have wanted to live?
  - Those are your life goals.  From there, all your normal goals and projects should align somewhere to those life goals; otherwise, you really have to ask yourself, why are you doing this?  what happens if i don't do this?
  - It is easy to say yes to everything, you need to have a test that makes it harder.  If you are spending your time on something that isn’t tied to a life goal, you are kinda wasting your lifebut it can be a very pleasant experience in the sense that I started to bucket projects and normal goals to life goals that I didn’t realize were connected.  And that really helps make things more manageable.

## Advanced Systems

The above system is simplest and works.  But it will eventually run into limitations.  These systems introduce 1 layer more of complexity but are useful if you are trying to accomplish more projects.



- burndown list and other work surfaces
  - there's things that need to get done that aren't deserving of a project or prioritization.  or they are small projects that are low important and low urgency.
  - "weekend"
  - "calls"
  - "outside"
  - "waiting"
  - "burndown"
  - if you can check these tags with a reliability and consistency, then you'll have the confidence to tag tasks with those and forget about them; because you know you'll come back to them at the appropriate work surface.  
  - another way to think of this is, instead of a due date to know to work on it, you are giving it a work context to know when to work on it.  e.g. this task is due when i have time to make calls.
  - when used right, work surfaces can create space for working on tasks that you wouldn't have otherwise used, which leads to more productivity.
- quarterly planning
  - When your weekly planning feels too stressful because you can’t fit everything in, and you keep deferring projects to next week over and over, then I’d start doing quarterly planning
  - try to get texture of the quarter.  some months are just smaller due to vacation, tax season, holidays.  december is always half a month.
  - this texture helps you forecast where to roughly slot your projects and do a quick check if you are going to run up on time and an important & non-urgent project will become urgent.

- super categories of projects.  like WF or finance has many separate projects.



## Common problems



### Reactionary mode

Reactionary mode means you aren't proactively working on what you want, but responding to external pressures.  This leads to you not working towards your ideal life.

- could be focusing on urgent & non-important tasks vs important & not-urgent
- notifications from apps can be sucking away your focus
- too many newsletters constantly grabbing your attention
- some things need you to be reactive: day trading financial markets.  in that case, you won't effectively be able to plan your week.

### Email isn't your todo list

When going through your email in the morning, if something is actionable, log it into your todo system's inbox with the necessary info to be actionable and archive the email.
