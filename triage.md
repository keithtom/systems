# Triage Workflow





1. Does this task have a hard deadline and is it important?
   - Yes: Add deadline (add padding if you need)
2. No hard deadline.  Does this task have a work surface?
   - E.g. this is a big item (>5m or has context to load up before working), put it on the 'todo list'
   - or it is something that takes >5m and can be done whenever; put it on the weekend list or burndown list.
   - If it is less than 5m and important, just do it.

  - Most of the time, people think everything is important.  The easiest way to figure out what is 'truly' important is only in comparing it to your other 'important' items.  This is a much easier comparison because you can see the opportunity cost of doing one thing over another.  It is a relative comparison vs trying to figure out the absolute importance of a task.
